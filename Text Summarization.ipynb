      "A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.\\nThe genus Rosa is subdivided into four subgenera:\\nRoses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors.\n",
      "A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).\\nOrnamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China.[5] Many thousands of rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants.\n",
      "As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.\\nRed rose, the most well known rose\\nPeggy Martin climbing roses\\nSize can be as small as a thumbnail\\nThe hybrid garden rose \"Amber Flush\"\\nHybrid tea rose cultivar \\'Mrs. Herbert Stevens\\'\\nRoses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers.\n",
